Prior to my current role, I spent six years in industry working on speech processing, where I pioneered self-supervised learning approaches for speech (like masked predictive coding <a href="/publications/#DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1910-09932">[7]</a> and contrastive learning <a href="/publications/#DBLP:conf/interspeech/JiangLCZL21">[8]</a>) and was among the first to deploy end-to-end ASR systems at production scale. Following the release of ChatGPT, I became deeply interested in foundation models and their potential, which motivated me to return to academia and complete my master's degree at JHU. There, I worked with Professor [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) and [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/), and also collaborated with Professor [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/) from Edinburgh and [Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/) from UT Austin on various research projects. Currently, I'm working as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, where I continue to pursue research in foundation models and related areas.

In my free time, I sometimes play Civ 6 or Hearthstone. I also rotate between tennis, badminton, swimming, and bouldering every day—well, more like every three or four days, but who's counting? [Research](https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/large-study-indicates-racket-sports-offer-best-protection-against-cardiac-death) shows racquet sports can reduce mortality risk by 47% and swimming by 28%—so between all these activities, I'm either achieving immortality or just really bad at math :) 

I've noticed there's something puzzle-like about all these activities—whether it's planning civilizations, crafting the perfect deck, or figuring out a tricky climbing route—which probably explains why I enjoy them alongside my research work.

  <div class="collapsible-content" id="industrial-career-details" style="display: none;">
    <p>My industrial career has been marked by a series of devastating external events that fundamentally disrupted the companies where I worked. At DiDi, I was developing speech processing systems when the company was hit by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2022/05/24/didi-to-delist-from-nyse-after-overwhelming-yes-vote-by-shareholders/?sh=4d105596cba0">severe regulatory action</a> from the Chinese government, forcing its delisting from the New York Stock Exchange and creating massive operational uncertainty. At YuanFuDao, my work was abruptly affected when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Reduction_Policy">Double Reduction Policy</a> essentially crippled the core business model of educational technology companies throughout China. Later at Shopee, the combination of global economic downturn and US-China tensions triggered an 80% stock price collapse and <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2022/09/why-is-e-commerce-giant-shopee-on-a-layoff-spree/">extensive layoffs</a> throughout the company. These successive corporate disruptions necessitated my transitions between roles, as each company faced existential challenges that made continuing my technical work there untenable.</p>
