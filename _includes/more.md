In my past life, I spent six years working in the industry on speech processing and speech foundation models. Recently, my focus has shifted to LLMs. To that end, I'm currently studying at JHU as a master's student, working with Professor [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) and [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/). I've also worked with Professor [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/) from Edinburgh and [Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/) from UT Austin.

My industrial career has been marked by a series of devastating external events that fundamentally disrupted the companies where I worked. At DiDi, I was developing speech processing systems when the company was hit by [severe regulatory action](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2022/05/24/didi-to-delist-from-nyse-after-overwhelming-yes-vote-by-shareholders/?sh=4d105596cba0) from the Chinese government, forcing its delisting from the New York Stock Exchange and creating massive operational uncertainty. At YuanFuDao, my work was abruptly affected when the [Double Reduction Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Reduction_Policy) essentially crippled the core business model of educational technology companies throughout China. Later at Shopee, I was advancing speech technologies when the combination of global economic downturn and US-China tensions triggered an 80% stock price collapse and [extensive layoffs](https://techwireasia.com/2022/09/why-is-e-commerce-giant-shopee-on-a-layoff-spree/) throughout the company. These successive corporate disruptions necessitated my transitions between roles, as each company faced existential challenges that made continuing my technical work there untenable.

In my free time, I sometimes play [Civ 6](https://civilization.2k.com/) or [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us). I also run and go bouldering every other day - well, more like every three or four days, but who's counting? I've noticed there's something puzzle-like about all these activities—whether it's planning civilizations, crafting the perfect deck, or figuring out a tricky climbing route—which probably explains why I enjoy them alongside my research work.
