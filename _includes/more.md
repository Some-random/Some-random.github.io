In my past life, I spent six years working in the industry on speech processing and speech foundation models. Recently, my focus has shifted to foundation models. I completed my master's degree at JHU, where I worked with Professor [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) and [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/). I've also collaborated with Professor [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/) from Edinburgh and [Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/) from UT Austin. Currently, I'm working as an Applied Scientist at Amazon, where I continue to pursue research in foundation models and related areas.


In my free time, I sometimes play [Civ 6](https://civilization.2k.com/) or [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us). I also play tennis, badminton, and go bouldering every other day - well, more like every three or four days, but who's counting? I've noticed there's something puzzle-like about all these activities—whether it's planning civilizations, crafting the perfect deck, or figuring out a tricky climbing route—which probably explains why I enjoy them alongside my research work.

  <div class="collapsible-content" id="industrial-career-details" style="display: none;">
    <p>My industrial career has been marked by a series of devastating external events that fundamentally disrupted the companies where I worked. At DiDi, I was developing speech processing systems when the company was hit by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2022/05/24/didi-to-delist-from-nyse-after-overwhelming-yes-vote-by-shareholders/?sh=4d105596cba0">severe regulatory action</a> from the Chinese government, forcing its delisting from the New York Stock Exchange and creating massive operational uncertainty. At YuanFuDao, my work was abruptly affected when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Reduction_Policy">Double Reduction Policy</a> essentially crippled the core business model of educational technology companies throughout China. Later at Shopee, the combination of global economic downturn and US-China tensions triggered an 80% stock price collapse and <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2022/09/why-is-e-commerce-giant-shopee-on-a-layoff-spree/">extensive layoffs</a> throughout the company. These successive corporate disruptions necessitated my transitions between roles, as each company faced existential challenges that made continuing my technical work there untenable.</p>
