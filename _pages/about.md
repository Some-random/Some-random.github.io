I am broadly interested in **reasoning**. In the realm of reasoning, I've worked on:

<ul><li><strong>Building general-purpose verifier</strong> through rationale extraction from unlabelled data to provide process supervision during reasoning <a href="/publications/#supervision">[1]</a> (mentioned in Lilian Weng's <a href="https://bit.ly/44ChA3B">blog</a>)</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Investigating the effectiveness of CoT prompting</strong> across 100+ papers and 20 datasets and discovering CoT benefits mainly math/symbolic reasoning tasks <a href="/publications/#cot">[2]</a> (<a href="https://bit.ly/4lLMnSy">discussion</a> with Jason Wei)</li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Theorem proving and Logical reasoning</strong> that uses theorem prover <a href="https://lean-lang.org/">Lean</a> to help with the reasoning process <a href="/publications/#lean">[3]</a></li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Decompositional entailment</strong> that formulates a consistent and theoretically grounded approach to annotating decompositional entailment dataset <a href="/publications/#decompos">[4]</a></li></ul>


I'm also interested in the **self-improvement** capability of LLMs. If we begin with the "end" (superintelligence/AGI) in mind, relying on human input won't get us there. We need to teach models to interact with the environment and self-improve.

<ul><li><strong>Understanding the reason</strong> that prevents LLM from effective self-improvement <a href="/publications/#self-[in]correct">[5]</a></li></ul>
<ul><li><strong>Probing the limits</strong> of self-improvement even with high-quality feedback <a href="/publications/#friction">[6]</a></li></ul>


Recently, I've been looking into **reinforcement learning** and **agents** — I don't really want to overextend myself, but these are fundamental areas that are too important to overlook.

    <p>I believe these the two research directions I'm interested in are <strong>deeply interconnected</strong> and can synergistically enhance each other. Strong reasoning capabilities are essential for effective self-improvement, as models need to logically analyze and discriminate between good and bad generations to provide meaningful feedback. Conversely, self-improvement mechanisms are crucial for advancing reasoning capabilities, as complex logical problems often require multiple attempts and refinements to reach the correct solution. This bidirectional relationship suggests that advancing either area could create positive feedback loops that benefit both capabilities.</p>
    
    <p>I'm also interested in pursuing research in <strong>multi-modal systems</strong>, which can make use of my previous expertise in speech processing and my current expertise in LLMs. The convergence of different modalities presents exciting opportunities for building stronger AI systems.</p>
