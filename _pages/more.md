With six years of industry and research experience in speech processing and self-supervised models, my focus is shifting to LLM. To that end, I'm currently studying at JHU as a master's student, working with Professor [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/) and [Benjamin Van Drume](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/). I've also worked with Professor [Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/) from Edinburgh and [Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/) from UTA.


Reflecting on my career, I've observed a pattern where significant external events have impacted my role. 
While I was getting comfortable with my role at DiDi, the company encountered [serious regulatory issues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2022/05/24/didi-to-delist-from-nyse-after-overwhelming-yes-vote-by-shareholders/?sh=4d105596cba0) with the Chinese government, resulting in its delisting from New York Stock Exchange.
During my time at YuanFuDao, the [Double Reduction Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Reduction_Policy) was introduced, which imposed strict restrictions on YuanFuDao's core business operations.
As I was adapting to my position at Shopee, the company's stock price dropped 80% due to the global economic crisis and the tensions between China and the US, leading to its [extensive layoffs](https://techwireasia.com/2022/09/why-is-e-commerce-giant-shopee-on-a-layoff-spree/).


In my free time, I sometimes play Civ 6 or Hearthstone. I also run and go bouldering every other day - well, more like every three or four days, but who's counting?
