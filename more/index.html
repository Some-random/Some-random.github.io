To that end, I’m currently studying at JHU as a master’s student, working with Professor <a href="https://danielkhashabi.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Daniel Khashabi</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Benjamin Van Drume</a>. I’ve also worked with Professor <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shay Cohen</a> from Edinburgh and <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Greg Durrett</a> from UTA.</p> <p>Reflecting on my career, I’ve observed a pattern where significant external events have impacted my role. While I was getting comfortable with my role at DiDi, the company encountered <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2022/05/24/didi-to-delist-from-nyse-after-overwhelming-yes-vote-by-shareholders/?sh=4d105596cba0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">serious regulatory issues</a> with the Chinese government, resulting in its delisting from New York Stock Exchange. During my time at YuanFuDao, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Reduction_Policy" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Double Reduction Policy</a> was introduced, which imposed strict restrictions on YuanFuDao’s core business operations. As I was adapting to my position at Shopee, the company’s stock price dropped 80% due to the global economic crisis and the tensions between China and the US, leading to its <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2022/09/why-is-e-commerce-giant-shopee-on-a-layoff-spree/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">extensive layoffs</a>.</p> <p>In my free time, I sometimes play Civ 6 or Hearthstone. I also run and go bouldering every other day - well, more like every three or four days, but who’s counting?</p> </article> </body></html>
